			<Text>The biggest inspiration for Four Seasons came from Northgard, a Viking themed real time strategy game with a Season system.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_CONCEPTS_PAGE_FOUR_SEASONS_INTRODUCTION_CHAPTER_INSPIRATION_PARA_2" Language="en_US">
			<Text>In my very first game, my advisors kept saying that Winter is imminent, suggesting I take precautions. I didn't really bother since my game was going pretty good. Then the Winter came, a particular cold one. Tons of wood was needed to heat houses and food to prevent starvation and disease, but my stored resources did not last long. When it started warming up again, only one in four of my citizens survived.</Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_CONCEPTS_PAGE_FOUR_SEASONS_INTRODUCTION_CHAPTER_INSPIRATION_PARA_3" Language="en_US">
			<Text>Going through this in Northgard and coming back to Civilization VI, the forefront of 4X, I asked myself: why is this kind of Season system not here? The variety it provides to the gameplay is immense, forcing you to change up your playstyle every now and then. With this in mind I took the decision to create the Four Seasons.</Text>

			<Text>Each Season and its Effects have a big impact on the struggle of survival for humans, animals, and plants alike. In Four Seasons, these Effects are applied globally to all Units and Cities, depending on the current Season and its randomized Severity. But not every Effect is changed in a Season, no changes to the game is also possible.</Text>

		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_CONCEPTS_PAGE_FOUR_SEASONS_EFFECTS_CHAPTER_CONTENT_PARA_5" Language="en_US">
			<Text>[ICON_Bullet][ICON_Promotion] Experience: The worse the [ICON_Damaged] Healing and [ICON_Movement] Movement Season Effects, the higher the additional Unit [ICON_Promotion] Experience. Basically, having fought in tough conditions strengthens your Units. This adds a reward for risking your Units when they have penalties.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_CONCEPTS_PAGE_FOUR_SEASONS_EFFECTS_CHAPTER_CONTENT_PARA_6" Language="en_US">
			<Text>[ICON_Bullet][ICON_Damaged] Healing per [ICON_Turn] Turn: Low temperatures, more hunger, no shelter, or the opposite. All this can have impact on the [ICON_Damaged] Healing of your Units. In later Eras, having enough Medics or Supply Convoys is essential if you want to keep your Units healthy.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_CONCEPTS_PAGE_FOUR_SEASONS_EFFECTS_CHAPTER_CONTENT_PARA_7" Language="en_US">
			<Text>[ICON_Bullet][ICON_Gold] Maintenance: Humans need more nutrition, sleep, and warmer clothes in Winter. Prepare for a hard Season by having enough gold in your treasury to finance the extra needs of your Units.</Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_CONCEPTS_PAGE_FOUR_SEASONS_EFFECTS_CHAPTER_CONTENT_PARA_8" Language="en_US">
			<Text>[ICON_Bullet][ICON_Movement] Movement for Land Units and Aircraft: Mud, floods and ice can all result in a terrain being harder to traverse or planes having a harder time landing, lowering the [ICON_Movement] Movement.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_CONCEPTS_PAGE_FOUR_SEASONS_EFFECTS_CHAPTER_CONTENT_PARA_9" Language="en_US">
			<Text>[ICON_Bullet][ICON_Movement] Movement for Naval Units: Water is denser in low temperatures, icebergs can be in the way or the water can freeze completely. But overall, these things are rare and the impact of Seasons on ships is lower, that is why there are separate [ICON_Movement] Movement Effects for Naval Units.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_CONCEPTS_PAGE_FOUR_SEASONS_EFFECTS_CHAPTER_CONTENT_PARA_10" Language="en_US">
			<Text>[ICON_Bullet][ICON_Food] Food per Tile: For most groceries, harvests are in Summer and Autumn, which can result in hunger in Winter and Spring. It can be beneficial to change the focus of your Cities to [ICON_Food] Food occasionally.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_CONCEPTS_PAGE_FOUR_SEASONS_EFFECTS_CHAPTER_CONTENT_PARA_11" Language="en_US">

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_CONCEPTS_PAGE_FOUR_SEASONS_SEVERITY_CHAPTER_CONTENT_PARA_1" Language="en_US">
			<Text>Just like the real world, the Season intensity can dither a lot. Four Seasons emulates these seasonal anomalies by assigning a Severity value to each Season at its beginning. This value determines how mild or severe the Effects are. The Severity is in a 1 to 5 range in Summer, Autumn, and Spring and between 1 and 6 in Winter. The higher the value, the worse the Effects.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_CONCEPTS_PAGE_FOUR_SEASONS_SEVERITY_CHAPTER_CONTENT_PARA_2" Language="en_US">
			<Text>In order to increase unpredictability and variety in the gameplay, the Severity is randomized. The Severity probabilities of the Seasons are dependent on the Severity Bias that you chose in the Game Setup. Your value sets the severity that is most likely to occur, basically setting the difficulty of the game.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_CONCEPTS_PAGE_FOUR_SEASONS_SEVERITY_CHAPTER_CONTENT_PARA_3" Language="en_US">
			<Text>A Winter with Severity 6 can always occur, though it is likelier if the last Season had a high Severity and if the Severity Bias is high. On average, Severity 6 occurs in about 3% (Bias 1) to 9% (Bias 5) of all Winters.</Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_CONCEPTS_PAGE_FOUR_SEASONS_SEASONLENGTH_CHAPTER_CONTENT_PARA_1" Language="en_US">
			<Text>You have the option to set a Season Length between 5 and 25 [ICON_Turn] Turns in the advanced options of the game setup. Note that your Season Length is only used as an approximation. A randomized Season Offset can delay or speed up a season change (see the chapter below for more information). For gameplay and balancing reasons, it is recommended to choose a Season Length that correlates with your chosen Game Speed:</Text>

		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_CONCEPTS_PAGE_FOUR_SEASONS_SEASONLENGTH_CHAPTER_CONTENT_PARA_7" Language="en_US">
			<Text>The Season Length also influences the AI in its decision making. A severe Season can lower the chances of the AI preparing for war. Then, if a mild Season comes up, the AI prepares for war again, but needs enough time to do so. Therefore, the Season Length should be at the upper end if you prefer a bit more aggressiveness and at the lower end if you want your rival Civilizations to be a little more passive. But overall, the influence on the AI is only minor.</Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_CONCEPTS_PAGE_FOUR_SEASONS_OFFSETS_TITLE" Language="en_US">
			<Text>Offsets</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_CONCEPTS_PAGE_FOUR_SEASONS_OFFSETS_CHAPTER_CONTENT_PARA_1" Language="en_US">
			<Text>Not only can the Severity of a Season vary, but also, its starting and ending point. A randomized Offset implements these variances and can delay or speed up the beginning of a Season. This also has an impact on the Length of a Season.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_CONCEPTS_PAGE_FOUR_SEASONS_OFFSETS_CHAPTER_CONTENT_PARA_2" Language="en_US">
			<Text>Say that the current game has a Season Length of 10 [ICON_Turn] Turns, and its start [ICON_Turn] Turn is 1. This would put the Season beginnings at [ICON_Turn] Turn 11, 21, 31 and so on. Here, the randomized Offset comes into play. The range in which the Season Offset operates is 20% of the Season Length, in this case 0.2 * 10 = 2 (this value is always topped off, for example 0.2 * 9 = 1.8 results in 1).</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_CONCEPTS_PAGE_FOUR_SEASONS_OFFSETS_CHAPTER_CONTENT_PARA_3" Language="en_US">
			<Text>Subtract and add this value to the original Season change [ICON_Turn] Turns (11, 21, 31 and so on) and you have your time frame for Season beginnings: 11 â€“ 2 = 9 is the earliest possible start Turn, 11 + 2 = 13 is the last possible start Turn.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_CONCEPTS_PAGE_FOUR_SEASONS_OFFSETS_CHAPTER_CONTENT_PARA_4" Language="en_US">
			<Text>Note that the probabilities for Season Offsets are equally distributed, unlike the Severity of a Season. Applying this to our example means that the Season change [ICON_Turn] Turns 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 all have the same probability.</Text>

			<Text>It was important to create a feeling of authenticity for every Season. That is why the animated time of day changes, if enabled by the player in the game setup, with the Seasons: every time a [ICON_Turn] Turn begins, the time of day skips a few minutes or hours, based on the Season Length.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_CONCEPTS_PAGE_FOUR_SEASONS_VISUALS_CHAPTER_CONTENT_PARA_2" Language="en_US">
			<Text>[ICON_Exclamation] Deactivate 'Animated Time of Day' in the options to make the Visuals work properly. If that option is enabled, the time of day changes automatically and then this mod possibly turns back the time. This is not game breaking but can be annoying when looking at the map.</Text>
