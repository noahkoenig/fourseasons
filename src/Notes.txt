TODO
- All Units have at least 1 movement left, independent from movement change
	we could flag the units that had their movement increase so that they are not 0 with SetPropety. that seems to working for all objects, not just the Game object
- Option for era based changes? The higher the era, the higher the negative effects
- Add new effect: Amenities
- Add food storage feature? you can store away food during spring / summer / autumn to prepare for coming winters
- Effect on Gathering Storm natural disasters? This seems impossible to do. you can adjust the overal disaster intensity but not the probabilities of individual natural disasters
  1 blizzards
  2 droughts
  3 dust storms
  4 floods
  5 forest fires
  6 hurricanes
  7 tornadoes


KNOWN ISSUES
- Plot yields are sometimes not shown in City Details view after they were changed
- Unit healing fortification is sometimes interrupted when the healing rate is reduced

Version 0.5

Features
- Added an option to set a severity bias in the game setup. The severity you choose (between 1 and 5) will be the most likely severity, effectively setting the difficulty of the game
- The settings you choose in the advanced game setup now show when hovering the icon in the beginning of the game as a little confirmation

Balance
- War weariness effect values are now based on the current era. The later the era, the higher the weariness
- Severity 6 winter can now occur no matter what severity autumn had. The chances of severity 6 are higher with a higher severity bias
- Naval units now have no movement (representing water freezing) in a severity 6 winter
- Lower food yields in winter



Version 0.4.1

Bugs
- Fixed an issue where the mod would not initialize when playing Vanilla



Version 0.4

Misc
- Improved performance when season changes are made. Especially big maps now run smoother

Version 0.3

Features
- Added Civilopedia entry with all details of the mod
- Added an option to deactivate the ambient time of day based on the current season in the game setup
- Added an animation for the ambient time of day. The transitions are now smooth

Balance
- Unit Experience is now reduced in Seasons with bonuses to Healing and / or Movement
- The margins with severity probabilities are now equal, making severity 1 or 5 less likely and 2 or 4 more likely
- A few effect changes, mainly healing and experience changes in autumn and winter because there was bonus experience without any negative unit effects

Misc
- .modinfo file is now up to date with infos from the recent updates



Version 0.2

Features
- Added unit experience as a bonus when attacking. The worse the seasonal unit effects, the more experience
- Added severity for summer. Severities 1-3 bring bonuses, 5 brings small penalties
- Seasons can now change from severity 1 to 5 as I removed the +-2 range. High anomalies are unlikelier

Balance
- Changed the probability distributions of the new season. Extremes are now more likely
- A few effects changes, mainly: spring is now less severe for units and can even bring bonuses
- Slightly smaller time window for season changes

Bugs
