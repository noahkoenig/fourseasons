### Four Seasons
Works with Vanilla, Rise and Fall and Gathering Storm. No requirements. \
I will expand this mod every now and then with the help of feedback.

### Overview
- This mod adds a Season system with Summer, Autumn, Winter and Spring to the game.
- Positive or negative Effects are applied to units and cities depending on the current Season and its randomized Severity. AI is naturally affected too.
- The map colors and lighting can change with the Seasons: dark and cold in Winter, bright and warm in Summer.
- With *Four Seasons*, planning of wars and food management is more important.

### Setup and Details
- All aspects of this mod are thoroughly described among Concepts in the Civilopedia. The essential ones are:
- You can set a Season Length between 5 and 25 turns. It is recommended to choose a value that correlates with your game speed (see image above). Note that your Season Length is only used as an approximation, randomized Offsets can delay or speed up a Season change.
- A randomized Severity (1 to 5, higher is worse) dictates how mild or severe Season Effects are. You can choose a Severity Bias (1 to 5) that sets the most likely Severity and thus, the game difficulty.
- The Season Effects include: unit experience, healing, maintenance, movement, food, production and war weariness.
- If you activate the Time of Day based on the Season in the game setup: **Deactivate 'Animated Time of Day'** in the options for the visual effects to work properly.
- After starting, an icon in the top right lists all important information (see images above). The game will always start in Summer with no Effects.

### Language
I only provide an English Version of this mod, but others can translate it and I will link it here:
